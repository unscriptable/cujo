Head over to the wiki for an introduction before digging in.

[[cujo.js wiki|http://github.com/unscriptable/cujo/wiki]]

Note: cujo.js requires dojo 1.5.0 or higher

We're moving over to AMD-style modules in the amd branch.  This will very likely be the future of cujo.js.

You will need an async loader to use cujo in the amd branch.  We're testing with a fork of [[RequireJS 0.15 https://github.com/unscriptable/requirejs]], but will be switching to its spider branch soon.  This means that you could also use any other CommonJS loader that uses the [[LoaderPlugin proposed API http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/LoaderPlugin]], for instance, the [[backdraft Loader http://bdframework.org/docs/loader/loader.html]].

You need to configure several paths for any AMD impementation to work.  More details to follow very shortly.
